# Java – Object-Oriented Programming (1DV502)

This repository contains assignments and a mini project from the course **Object-Oriented Programming (1DV502, 7.5 credits)** at Linnaeus University.  
The course focuses on developing a deeper understanding of object-oriented analysis, design, and programming in Java.

##  Course Topics
- Fundamental OOP concepts: classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
- Modularization, abstraction, and encapsulation
- UML class and sequence diagrams
- Unit testing with JUnit
- Implementation of common design patterns (Singleton, Iterator, Observer, Factory)

##  Structure
- `assignment_1/` → Basic OOP principles  
- `assignment_2/` → Modularization and abstraction  
- `assignment_3/` → UML and unit testing  
- `assignment_4/` → Design patterns  
- `mini_project/` → Final project combining OOP concepts  
- `README.md` → This file

##  Skills Demonstrated
- Writing Java programs with multiple classes
- Applying OOP principles in practice
- Modeling and testing using UML and JUnit
- Implementing and explaining design patterns
- Structuring software projects for clarity and maintainability
