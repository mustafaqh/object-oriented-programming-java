# Reflection on my Intended Design
class diagram it's the same number of classes and that's because of my understanding of the requirements. as I understood that we need a class called board which I thought to make it a base class for tile which would be a subclass but after I read more requirements I found that there are three types of Tile so I decided to make Tile as a base class with three subclasses which are Start, Free, and Property the same way as I saw in inheritance lecture, there was an example about people which was the base class with two types teachers and students and every type has attributes. and I created a class called Dice because dice is the main part of this game, then I created a class Game that will send a message to the start and end of the game. and I created the  Player class to determine the name and fund of every player, and an interface class called to do as a contract because in this game players have more than one thing to do like roll, move, buy, pay rent. and I created another class called player interface and I created this class according to requirements. I had followed the requirements so there are not many differences in classes name except the user interface in the requirement I called it player interface because I thought the user is the player and don't have a console UI in my diagram I had todo interface because I thought that I will need a class to roll and move other actions. 
In my diagram, I used dependency and association relationships and I didn't use id-connections because I was able to understand the association and dependency more through the lectures after I looked at the diagram that we get in assignment three I didn't find any difference but I didn't choose the right arrows to represent the dependency relationship between classes. one of the most important things I learned is to divide the behavior into different classes instead of on classes like the todo class and player interface where every interface is responsible for some behavior. I could understand that by understanding the requirements.
in the object diagram, I didn't represent a specific moment for the game and that's was a mistake and that's because I didn't choose a value for dices but I represented the player and the game and dices and the streets that been mentioned in the scenario, I meant with the links between the street that the player can move forward and backward the street where the player stands. the sequence diagram is missing the combined fragments I was focusing on how I will present the scenario that we were asked for. I hope that I did good work it took a very long time for me to do this part of the assignment I had to go through all the lectures again and that's was good for me and in the beginning, I didn't understand the dependency but the assignment helped me to get a better understand of the dependency relationship and after I looked at the design in the third assignment I found that I used a wrong arrow to represent the association relationship so now Iâ€™v learned that too.
